The error vmware-could-not-open-dev-vmmon commonly occurs when trying to run VMware on certain Linux distributions. This error typically indicates issues with the VMware kernel module (vmmon) not being loaded properly or permission issues with the /dev/vmmon device file.
Causes:

    Kernel Module Not Loaded: The vmmon module, which VMware requires to function, is not loaded into the kernel.
    Permissions Issues: The /dev/vmmon device file may have incorrect permissions, preventing VMware from accessing it.
    Outdated VMware Version: Using an outdated version of VMware that may not be fully compatible with the current kernel version.

Symptoms:

    VMware fails to start virtual machines.
    Error message displayed: Could not open /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory. Please make sure that the kernel module 'vmmon' is loaded.
    Inability to run VMware Workstation or Player.
Ensure your VMware installation is up to date.
Check for any system updates that might include kernel improvements.
Review VMware documentation for any additional troubleshooting steps specific to your Linux distribution.
The vmware-could-not-open-dev-vmmon error is a common issue encountered when attempting to run VMware Workstation or VMware Player on Linux systems. This error usually indicates that the VMware kernel module (vmmon) required to run virtual machines is either not loaded or has incorrect permissions.

Preventive Measures:

    Regular Updates:
        Keep VMware and your Linux distribution up to date to ensure compatibility.
    Kernel Module Auto-loading:
        Configure your system to load the vmmon module at startup by adding it to /etc/modules or using a systemd service.

By understanding the causes and solutions for the vmware-could-not-open-dev-vmmon error, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve this issue, ensuring a smooth experience with VMware on your Linux system.
Advanced Diagnostics and Solutions:

    Kernel Compatibility:
        Check Kernel Version:

        sh

    uname -r

    Ensure your kernel version is supported by the VMware version you are using. Sometimes newer kernels require patches or updates to VMware.

Module Rebuild:

    If the vmmon module fails to load after a kernel update, rebuilding the VMware modules may help.
    Rebuild VMware Modules:

    sh

    sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all

Secure Boot Issues:

    Secure Boot can prevent the loading of unsigned kernel modules.
    Disable Secure Boot:
        Reboot your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI settings.
        Find the Secure Boot option and disable it.
        Save and exit the BIOS/UEFI settings.
    Alternatively, you can sign the VMware modules with your own Secure Boot key.

SELinux/AppArmor:

    Security frameworks like SELinux and AppArmor can block access to /dev/vmmon.
    Check SELinux Status:

    sh

sestatus

Set SELinux to Permissive Mode:

sh

sudo setenforce 0

Check AppArmor Status:

sh

sudo aa-status

Disable AppArmor Profile for VMware:

sh

    sudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.vmware

Log Files:

    Review VMware log files for detailed error messages and hints.
    VMware Workstation Log File:
        Located in ~/.vmware/vmware.log
        Check for errors and warnings related to vmmon.

Alternative Fix for Permissions:

    Sometimes the permissions on /dev/vmmon get reset upon reboot. To make the changes persistent, add a udev rule:

    sh

    echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="misc", KERNEL=="vmmon", MODE="0666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-vmware.rules
    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
    sudo udevadm trigger

System Dependencies:

    Ensure all necessary system dependencies for VMware are installed:

    sh

    sudo apt-get install build-essential linux-headers-$(uname -r)

System Configuration Check:

    Sometimes misconfigurations in system files can cause issues. Ensure your /etc/vmware/config file is correctly set up:

    sh

        cat /etc/vmware/config

        Look for lines related to vmmon and ensure they are correctly configured.

    Community and Support:
        Engage with the VMware community for support and shared experiences.
        VMware Community Forums: VMware Communities
        Stack Overflow and Linux Forums: Search for solutions and ask for help.

Persistent Troubleshooting:

    Run VMware as Root:
        Running VMware as root can sometimes bypass permission issues, but it is not recommended for regular use due to security concerns:

        sh

sudo vmware

By exploring these advanced diagnostics, solutions, and preventive measures, you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve the vmware-could-not-open-dev-vmmon error, ensuring reliable operation of VMware on your Linux system.
